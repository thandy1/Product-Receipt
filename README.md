# 🧾 Digital Receipt Project

A simple HTML/CSS project that replicates a grocery store receipt — complete with itemized purchases, totals, and even a custom barcode. Designed to practice basic layout, styling, and clean markup structure.

## 🌐 Live Demo
[View the Receipt on GitHub Pages](https://thandy1.github.io/Product-Receipt/)  

## 💡 Features
- Responsive-style structure (no media queries yet)
- Clean itemization of products, prices, and totals
- Realistic receipt formatting with bold fonts and dividers
- **Stretch Challenge**: Custom barcode using styled `<span>` elements
- Minimalist aesthetic using monospace fonts and background contrast

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (no frameworks)
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📘 What I Learned
- Flexbox usage for layout alignment
- Scoped styling for specific sections (e.g., `.items p` vs global `p`)
- Handling display issues caused by global CSS defaults
- Structuring semantic HTML for clarity and maintainability

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add media queries for mobile responsiveness
- Auto-generate barcode with JavaScript
- Store data dynamically with JavaScript and/or external files
